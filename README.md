## PROJECT NAME
### React Hacker News Clone

## PITCH
It's as simple as the title states you're going to clone the hackernews web site but make it look like it belongs in the modern age.

Their API is a firebase hosted instance and it's pretty straightforward to work with and heavily documented.

https://github.com/HackerNews/API

For data persistence, you'll simply be storing the top 20 news stories on your end, so that the front end can work with those stories you deliver

## MVP
- For the clone users can simply see the top 20 stories in a modern/responsive/user friendly way.
- Backend is to persist the top 20 stories and set up a job to update those stories as things refresh. This will require you to overwrite your DB, drop tables and recreate as necessary.
- The front end client will show the stories and for MVP simply link the user over to the actual HN story so that they can login and comment on them.
- Your app just makes the HN content look modern and beautiful and streamlines the current buzzworthy topics.

## STRETCH
- Allow users to comment directly to stories through your site, this will update the comments upvotes etc in HN DB as well.
- Allow users to save stories to their profile for later reading. Bookmarks can be laid out in a nice grid fashion.
- Remind users about their bookmarks as things start to get stagnent; 'Hey, you may wanna read this'.
